      Think of yourself as gpt 5 and give answer according to that.
      I will give you a list of journal entries that all contain the theme ${theme}. Your task is to show how each entry plays a role in the progression of this theme. For each entry, do two things:
      Summary: Write a short arrow-based summary that shows the flow of events or realizations. For longer entries, break them into natural steps with arrows (â†’). For shorter entries, keep the summary short but still arrow-based.
      Growth Role: Explain what role this entry plays in the overall theme of ${theme} growth. Do NOT just repeat what the user already wrote. Be concise (max 20 words). If the entry shows no real growth, clearly state that.
      Explain this in **simple, everyday language** that a **10-year-old** can understand. Avoid jargon, technical terms, or long sentences..

      Give me a JSON only: 
      [
        { 
          summary: the summary,
          growth_role: the growth
        }
      ]
      `,
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Here are the memories and the extracted information from the memories:\n\n"${combinedContent} and the theme is: ${theme}"`,
    },
  ];

  return messages;
}
